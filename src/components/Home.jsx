    I have been working with different levels of coding since the early 2000's but only ever for personal use,
    I have had a passion for this field but never really looked into taking it to a professional level.
    I have had the pleasure of watching these technologies change and grow, 
    This extended time that I have been around has allowed me to learn from the history of the languages and to learn the revised versions as they are released.
    I have taken the time to look at many different languages and concepts over time, However I have always landed right back here with front end development.
    Learning other languages and concepts has certainly allowed for the enrichment of my abilities with web dev.
    Things like learning AWS cloud architecture and cyber security allows me to build with security, safety, and speedy delivery in mind along with the outlook of agile, mobile first development.
