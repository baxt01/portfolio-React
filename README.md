# Portfolio-React
This Reactjs project has been both fun and tormenting to build,
I have added the Nav-bar feature directly into the header component,
Then I have added the header component directly into the App.jsx component.
Building things this way has allowed the header and nav to load seamlessly on every page.
Then I have worked through breaking down the rest of the sites into components,
I finished off with creating individual CSS files for each components along with using Bootstrap to bring the whole thing together.
